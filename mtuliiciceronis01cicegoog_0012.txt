Tsn text of this edition of Cicero de Oratore, with a
lew inconsiderable exceptione, is that cs Ernesti.' The
edition of Dr. Carep has furnished some corrections iu
the punctuation. In selecting notes, it’was at first iu· .
tended to give short extracts from the principal commen·
¹taries'on this work, especially those ol Proust, Olivet and
Ernesti, as scholia to the more difficult passages3 amode
olillustration, as wa‘s thought, well adapted to the wants
of those, who usually read this treatise in the course
of their education. After a considerable portion of the
text was printed, it was determined, at the suggestion of
the publishers, to' give apert of the notes in English.
The number os Latin notes is less, than was at first con-¹
templated. Thewhole number of notes is smalh and it-
is recommended to the student, m reading this work, to
have by him the Olenia Ciceroniana os Ernesti3 as airh

this help properly used, he willae ld'om be left tm doubt .

as to the meaning of his author? It will he observed,
l,'hat m the notes, no account is given or the orators, po·
ets, philosophans and historiam, hhose ha'tres so sre-
quently occur in these dinlogues Sirch accounts have
been omitted, as the student can easily find thern tn a
classical dictionary. J. L. K,
